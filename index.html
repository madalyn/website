					What I'm looking For
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm looking to join a team where I can be a key contributer and where I am appreciated for my broad skill set. I like to wear many different hats because my thirst for knowledge is easily stimulated. I've had a lot of fun working for startups, it's part of my DNA.
