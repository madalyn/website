					About Me
				</h2>
				<p>
					When I was 16 I discovered I had a love for software and have been writing code ever since. For me, software is the perfect fusion of my many interests. I am very artistic and love the feeling of bringing more beautiful creations into the world. At the same time I excel in mathematics because I love the mental challenge of always solving the next puzzle. I'm a lover of rubik's cubes, trivia, and brain teasers. My unique way of thinking around problems leads me to being a key player in brainstorming ideas, as well as speaking up. If you have a problem that needs a solution, I will think of several ways to tackle it.

					What I'm looking For
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm looking to join a team where I can be a key contributer and where I am appreciated for my broad skill set. I like to wear many different hats because my thirst for knowledge is easily stimulated. I've had a lot of fun working for startups, it's part of my DNA.

				<h2>More About Me</h2>
				<div class="quote position-relative">

					</div>
				<p>
				I love languages, and I love writing. Just like in writing an essay, code should be orderly, clean, and clearly demonstrate its intent. My patience is limited for developers who only care about code functionality, with little regard to its maintainability and comprehension. I can take jarbled code and make it clear for others to reliably use in the future, but I believe our time is better spent if all developers put better care into this aspect of their writing style.

				<h3>Women in Technology</h3>
				<p>
				I am an advocate for women in technology. I was the President of Women in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute for two years while I was a student there. I have attended Google Women Techmakers and the Grace Hopper Celebration. At Vistaprint, I was an active member in WIT and was involved in the orchestration of many large-scale events, including planning Act-W Boston in 2017. I am happy to be a supporter and champion of Women in Technology wherever I go, and I look to get involved in any company WIT events.
				<br/><br/>

				As President of Women in CS at WPI, I learned a great deal of responsibility through organizing weekly meetings and activities for our 20+ members, running exec meetings with our 5 execs, coordinating networking, recruiting, and social events with many Boston companies, recruiting members to our club through events several times throughout the academic year, and representing our organization with the WPI CS faculty and department head. I also had to organize our budget, and maintain our schedule.
				<br/><br/>

				I speak to this experience because I learned valuable lessons about people and time management, networking, presenting, and negotiating. I see myself as a team lead in a few years, and I know I already have all the right tools to excel in a leadership role.
				<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h3>My Values</h3>
				<p>
				A little more about me: I am an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality" target="_blank">INTP</a> personality type on the Myers-Briggs scale if that is of interest to you. However at the same time I am an emathetic person who cares deeply about others. I love animals, and I love plants and gardening. I eat plant-based, meaning I try to consume as few animal products as possible; I've been eating this way since about 2014 after watching Forks Over Knives. I love it, but I believe everyone has to choose what lifestyle is best for them. I'm non-judgemental, and I believe all of us are equal and deserve equal respect. However I don't tolerate elitists or those who put down other people. It is always importent to me to make others feel valued and heard. I'm open-minded, and I love hearing about ideas and experiences different from my own. I love teamwork. I am very honest (sometimes to my own detremint) as I highly value integrety and am fiercly principled. I am a musician, mainly as a pianist, but I am happy to play any instrument lying around. I love yoga and try to at least fit in some deep breathing once per day.
				<br/><br/>

				I love meeting new people and learning all about them. Being an Introvert makes me a great listener! I don't always appear to be that introverted, but I am most comfortable in a one-on-one environment versus a group environment. I still enjoy working in groups, especially those with diverse opinions and ideas all coming together to solve a problem. That is why I love software engineering!
